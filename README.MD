## about
CatálogoZap is a website project where you can create a store (of any type) and list your products, including name, price, image, and description. When a customer wants to buy your product, they click a "Buy via WhatsApp" button and are redirected to a conversation with the store owner, who can then send a message indicating which product they want.

CatálogoZap is a project created for training purposes by two programming students from the <a href="https://www.incantarestudio.com/">Incantare</a> group: <a href="https://github.com/Lucca2013">Lucca</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RodrigoSID">Rodrigo</a>.
